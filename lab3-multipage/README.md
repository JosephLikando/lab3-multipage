The Services page gives a clear picture of what TRMS (Tax Revenue Management System) has to offer. Right at the top, there’s a hero section that introduces the services, and then below that, a grid layout breaks things down into easy-to-understand service cards. The main offerings—Tax Filing, Audit Services, Secure Payments, and Customer Support—are all displayed with a matching image and a short description. The whole page is designed to make sure users can quickly get what TRMS provides and how it helps with tax-related tasks.

index.html
The Home page is the first thing users see when they land on TRMS. It starts with a welcoming hero section that introduces TRMS as a system built to make tax management smoother for governments, businesses, and individuals. A little further down, there’s a section explaining what TRMS is all about—efficiency and transparency in tax collection. To make things even easier, there’s a sidebar with quick links, so users can jump straight to important tasks like checking tax returns, making payments, or reaching out for support. Basically, this page sets the tone and helps users dive right into what TRMS can do.

Contact.html
The Contact page is all about making it easy for users to reach out to TRMS. Right at the top, there’s a hero section inviting users to send inquiries. Below that, a simple and clean form collects the basics—name, email, subject, and message—so people can get in touch without hassle. The design is professional but user-friendly, making sure customer support is accessible to everyone who needs it.


Selectors – Used to style elements efficiently, including:

Class & ID selectors (.service-card, #hero-section) for targeted styling.

Pseudo-classes (:hover, :focus) for interactive effects.

Pseudo-elements (::before, ::after) for adding extra decorative content.

Flexbox & Grid – Ensure a structured and responsive layout:

Flexbox (display: flex;) aligns elements like the hero section and forms.

CSS Grid (display: grid;) organizes service cards neatly.

Media Queries – Make the site mobile-friendly:

Adjust layouts, font sizes, and button spacing for different screen sizes (@media).

Animation & Transitions – Enhance user experience with smooth effects:

Hover transitions (transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;) for interactive elements.

Keyframe animations (@keyframes) for motion effects like fades and slides.

Scroll effects (opacity, transform) for gradual element reveals.
